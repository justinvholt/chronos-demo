            If the demurrage rate specified in Part I clause (J) is expressed as a percentage of Worldscale such
            percentage shall be applied to the demurrage rate applicable to vessels of a similar size to the vessel
            as provided in Worldscale or, for the purpose of clause 10 and/or if this Charter is terminated prior
            to the commencement of loading, in Worldscale current at the termination date specified in Part I clause (C).
            Demurrage shall be paid per running day or pro rata for part thereof for all time which, under the provisions
            of this Charter, counts against laytime or for demurrage and which exceeds the laytime specified in Part I
            clause (I). Charterers' liability for exceeding the laytime shall be absolute and shall not in any case
            be subject to the provisions of Part II clause 32. (2) If, however, all or part of such demurrage arises
            out of or results from fire or explosion or strike or failure/breakdown of plant and/or machinery at ports
            of loading and/or discharging in or about the plant of Charterers, shippers or consignees of the cargo
            (not being a fire or explosion caused by the negligence or wilful act or omission of Charterers, shippers
            or consignees of the cargo or their respective servants or agents), act of God, act of war, riot, civil
            commotion, or arrest or restraint of princes, rulers or peoples, the laytime used and/or the rate of
            demurrage shall be reduced by half for such laytime used and/or for such demurrage or such parts thereof.
            (3) Owners shall notify Charterers within 60 days after completion of discharge if demurrage has been
            incurred and any demurrage claim shall be fully and correctly documented, and received by Charterers, within
            90 days after completion of discharge . If Owners fail to give notice of or to submit any such claim with
            documentation, as required herein, within the limits aforesaid, Charterers' liability for such demurrage shall be
            extinguished. (4) If any part cargo for other charterers, shippers or consignees (as the case may be) is
            loaded or discharged at the same berth, then any time used by the vessel waiting at or for such berth and in
            loading or discharging which would otherwise count as laytime or if the vessel is on demurrage for
            demurrage, shall be pro-rated in the proportion that Charterers’ cargo bears to the total cargo to be
            loaded or discharged at such berth. If however, the running of laytime or demurrage, if on demurrage,
            is solely attributable to other parties’ cargo operations then such time shall not count in calculating
            laytime or demurrage, if on demurrage, against Charterers under this Charter.",
